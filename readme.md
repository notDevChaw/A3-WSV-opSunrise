Before Pasting a mission into your mpmissions forlder please ensure you are downloading the whole reposotory as a zip

To Start please ensure you have loaded the current preset on your server/pc

Than Unzip the file and paste as is with all the assets inside the folder to ensure nothing breaks in game
if something does pop up its probably not important and you can ignore unless its .jpg files

So ,

1. Download repo as a Zip
2. Ensure Preset and all the mods are loaded
3. Paste the Mission folder within your mpmission folder
4. Go to Editor and make changes how ever you like
5. Enjoy !!!
